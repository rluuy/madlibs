# madlibs
Project Created and Implemented by Me and Alex for CSC335 - Object Oriented Programming and Design. 

• Designed an assignment detailing an implementation of a graphical, computer based Madlibs program 
• Required students to select from a premade list of Madlibs templates 
• Required students to parse the templates using Java Regular Expressions 
• Required students to validate user input via Part of Speech tagging with the Brown Corpus 
• Required students to overlay the template into a JavaFX GUI

This repo contains the implementation that I made to protoype the project before we released to students.
